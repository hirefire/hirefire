      # This method gets invoked when a new job has been queued
      #
      # Iterates through the default (or user-defined) job/worker ratio until
      # it finds a match for the for the current situation (see example).
      #
      # @example
      #   # Say we have 40 queued jobs, and we configured our job/worker ratio like so:
      #
      #   HireFire.configure do |config|
      #     config.max_workers      = 5
      #     config.job_worker_ratio = [
      #       { :jobs => 1,   :workers => 1 },
      #       { :jobs => 15,  :workers => 2 },
      #       { :jobs => 35,  :workers => 3 },
      #       { :jobs => 60,  :workers => 4 },
      #       { :jobs => 80,  :workers => 5 }
      #     ]
      #   end
      #
      #   # It'll match at { :jobs => 35, :workers => 3 }, (35 jobs or more: hire 3 workers)
      #   # meaning that it'll ensure there are 3 workers running.
      #
      #   # If there were already were 3 workers, it'll leave it as is.
      #
      #   # Alternatively, you can use a more functional syntax, which works in the same way.
      #
      #   HireFire.configure do |config|
      #     config.max_workers = 5
      #     config.job_worker_ratio = [
      #       { :when => lambda {|jobs| jobs < 15 }, :workers => 1 },
      #       { :when => lambda {|jobs| jobs < 35 }, :workers => 2 },
      #       { :when => lambda {|jobs| jobs < 60 }, :workers => 3 },
      #       { :when => lambda {|jobs| jobs < 80 }, :workers => 4 }
      #     ]
      #   end
      #
      #   # If there were more than 3 workers running (say, 4 or 5), it will NOT reduce
      #   # the number. This is because when you reduce the number of workers, you cannot
      #   # tell which worker Heroku will shut down, meaning you might interrupt a worker
      #   # that's currently working, causing the job to fail. Also, consider the fact that
      #   # there are, for example, 35 jobs still to be picked up, so the more workers,
      #   # the faster it processes. You aren't even paying more because it doesn't matter whether
      #   # you have 1 worker, or 5 workers processing jobs, because workers are pro-rated to the second.
      #   # So basically 5 workers would cost 5 times more, but will also process 5 times faster.
      #
      #   # Once all jobs finished processing (e.g. Delayed::Job.jobs == 0), HireFire will invoke a signal
      #   # which will set the workers back to 0 and shuts down all the workers simultaneously.
